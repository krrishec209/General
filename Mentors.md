16 resources to help you find a software development mentor to accelerate you career:

1. Your manager - this should be your first port of call, part of their role should be either acting as or finding you a suitable mentor.
2. Join an online community - either around your tech stack or your experience level.
3. Right here on LinkedIn - Network and build relationships with people like me.
4. Join an offline community - When I started out as a software developer I got a lot from the ACCU.
