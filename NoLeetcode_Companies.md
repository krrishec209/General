No more Leetcode. Yep, I’m serious. 😅

Read on for a list of 40 top companies who are saying yes to a better way. 👇

The only reason we do Leetcode is because Big Tech popularized it, and everyone copied them. 

Problems I see with this:

– Engineers are spending 1000 hrs grinding on leetcode
– Companies are copying others vs. choosing something for their situation
– Algorithm type memorization thinking is rewarded instead of on the job everyday skills

There are better ways:

– Code review challenges
– Short real world coding takehomes
– Short system design problem solving tests
– Data modeling and code patterns tests with follow up questions
– Etc. 

But Caleb, I need a job… 
I can’t just skip leetcode and beg companies to hire me. Yep, I hear you!

There are companies out there choosing a different way, and I finally have a list I can share with you!

I hope this starts a conversation about how we can do better as an industry, and that there are companies out there saying yes to that!
