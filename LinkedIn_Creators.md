A candidate was rejected in a frontend interview because he didn‚Äôt use useReducer over useStateüòû

If you've worked with React forms, you've probably encountered something like this: 

const [title, setTitle] = useState(''); 
const [description, setDescription] = useState(''); 
const [startDate, setStartDate] = useState(); 
const [endDate, setEndDate] = useState(); 
‚Ä¶.

At first, this looks fine. But as the form grows, so do the problems: 

Too many individual useState calls 
No built-in validation 
Risk of inconsistent state 

For example, there‚Äôs nothing preventing an end date from being before a start date or a title from exceeding a reasonable length. 

A Smarter Alternative: useReducer 

Instead of managing state in multiple places, useReducer centralizes everything. Here's how we simplify the above: 

const [event, updateEvent] = useReducer((prev, next) => { 
 const newEvent = { ...prev, ...next }; 

 if (newEvent.startDate > newEvent.endDate) { 
 newEvent.endDate = newEvent.startDate; 
 } 

 if (newEvent.title.length > 100) { 
 newEvent.title = newEvent.title.substring(0, 100); 
 } 

 return newEvent; 
}, { title: '', description: '', startDate: null, endDate: null }); 

Now, every update must pass through updateEvent, which ensures the state stays valid. 

These tiny details can make or break your chances. To dive deeper into these concepts, I recommend the Namaste React course by Akshay Saini üöÄ ‚Äî I‚Äôve personally found it super helpful during my job hunt.

They also offer Namaste Node.js and a Namaste Frontend System Design course, which are equally valuable.
