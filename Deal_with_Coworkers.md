> Working with them is good for you.
> Clearly describe the risk and how you plan to address it

­Ъца The Trailblazer
+ This person often feels the risk is justifiedorthey will propose ideas without scoping out the risk.
­ЮЎЃ­ЮЎц­ЮЎг ­ЮЎЕ­ЮЎц ­ЮЎг­ЮЎц­ЮЎД­ЮЎа ­ЮЎг­ЮЎъ­ЮЎЕ­ЮЎЮ ­ЮЎЕ­ЮЎЮ­ЮЎџ­ЮЎб:
> Ask them targeted questions and flesh out a more detailed plan with them.

­ЪўЉ The Stealthy Critic
+ They will have opinions but save them for the last minute before something is ready to ship.
­ЮЎЃ­ЮЎц­ЮЎг ­ЮЎЕ­ЮЎц ­ЮЎг­ЮЎц­ЮЎД­ЮЎа ­ЮЎг­ЮЎъ­ЮЎЕ­ЮЎЮ ­ЮЎЕ­ЮЎЮ­ЮЎџ­ЮЎб:
> Follow up with them directly on unanswered conversations.
> Have a 1:1 with them to go over their concerns and document it.
> Make sign-off explicit.

­ЪЦ│ The Opinionated One
+ TheyРђЎll leavea lotof suggestions on anything you do.
+ They might sidetrack meetings, talking about things that are not important right now.
­ЮЎЃ­ЮЎц­ЮЎг ­ЮЎЕ­ЮЎц ­ЮЎг­ЮЎц­ЮЎД­ЮЎа ­ЮЎг­ЮЎъ­ЮЎЕ­ЮЎЮ ­ЮЎЕ­ЮЎЮ­ЮЎџ­ЮЎб:

> Create a РђюNot in scopeРђЮ / РђюFuture considerationsРђЮ section in your design doc or code review to prevent too many suggestions.

­ЪДљ The Perfectionist
+ This is often because there is a difference in opinion of whatРђЎs important for the company. You might think shipping to the customer as quickly as possible is more important and they think code quality is.
­ЮЎЃ­ЮЎц­ЮЎг ­ЮЎЕ­ЮЎц ­ЮЎг­ЮЎц­ЮЎД­ЮЎа ­ЮЎг­ЮЎъ­ЮЎЕ­ЮЎЮ ­ЮЎЕ­ЮЎЮ­ЮЎџ­ЮЎб:

> Be direct and let them know what youРђЎre observing, but also show you care about them and want to know how you can support them.
> Bring it up with your manager. Let your manager know that youРђЎre worried about the impact on you and the team. 

­ЪўЕ The Overwhelmed Optimist
+ You rely on them for the work they do but they have too much on their plate.
­ЮЎЃ­ЮЎц­ЮЎг ­ЮЎЕ­ЮЎц ­ЮЎг­ЮЎц­ЮЎД­ЮЎа ­ЮЎг­ЮЎъ­ЮЎЕ­ЮЎЮ ­ЮЎЕ­ЮЎЮ­ЮЎџ­ЮЎб:
> Be understanding. You donРђЎt want to come across as demanding when they already have a heavy workload. 
> If the problem persists, respectfully share the impact but also offer help.
> If youРђЎve tried to resolve it with the person directly though and itРђЎs impacting the team, you should let your manager know.
