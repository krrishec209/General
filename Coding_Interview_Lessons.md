It took me 5 years to learn these 35 coding interview lessons.

You can learn them in 5 minutes:

1. Most interviewers want you to succeed.

2. Go with a winning mindset and be confident of your abilities.

3. Prepare a compelling introduction. Keep it short and crisp.

4. Be ready to discuss technical aspects of projects in your resume.

5. Understanding the problem well is the first step during interviews.

6. Never jump straight to the solution.

7. Ask good clarifying questions.

8. Mentally record any unique information present in the problem.

9. Write down 2-3 test cases to understand the input/output.

10. Listen carefully to the interviewer for hints/suggestions.

11. Never assume things which are not given in the problem.

12. It’s ok to use pen and paper and take notes during the interview.

13. Writing and visualizing on paper can unlock the creative part of your brain.

14. Ask for hints if stuck for long.

15. Pick a programming language you are most comfortable with.

16. Whenever stuck, start with a brute-force solution.

17. Solution first. Optimizations later.

18. Discuss your approach before you begin coding, not after.

19. Think aloud. Your interviewer can't read your mind.

20. Think of multiple solutions before committing to one.

21. State the time and space complexity upfront.

22. Break down complex questions into smaller problems.

23. Prioritize optimizing bottlenecks, unnecessary and duplicated work.

24. Start coding only when you know exactly what you are going to write.

25. Write clean, readable and modular code.

26. Reuse code whenever possible.

27. Use good variable names. No i, j, k, tmp.

28. Try to make your solution generic instead of hard-coding.

29. Dry run your solution on 2-3 sample inputs.

30. Don’t forget the edge cases. They can make or break your interview.

31. Your solution is as good as how well you communicate it.

32. Don’t ignore behavioral questions. They are important too.

33. Follow the STAR framework to answer behavioral questions.

34. Prepare few good questions to ask in the end.

35. Irrespective of the result, reflect on your interview experience.

Bonus: When you are completely stuck, do a Data Structure Brainstorm.
Run through list of common data structures and algorithms and try to apply each one.
Linked List? HashMaps? Heaps? Graphs? DFS?

I learned this trick from “Cracking the Coding Interview” book and found it useful.
Sometimes, knowing which data structure or algorithm to use can unlock the solution.
