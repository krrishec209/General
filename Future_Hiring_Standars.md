I was in a networking call with a Staff SWE at Google, this is what he said to me about the Future Hiring Standards for SWEs:

In the past year, he had conducted 100+ interviews

This is what he found:

- caught 30+ candidates cheating
- 41 candidates who solved medium-hard in virtual interview
- couldn’t solve a easy-medium in on-site interview
- good candidates are getting rejected because they don’t want to cheat

Here’s what he believes now:

Leetcode will NOT be the gold standard of hiring in the next 2-3 years

It’s already broken. Anyone can game it.

Here’s what he thinks future interviews will look like:

0. Debug this AI-written code

This function was generated by Copilot. It passes some tests but fails in edge cases. Fix it and explain what went wrong

=> What it tests:

- Deep understanding of logic
- Reading & improving AI output
- Confidence under uncertainty

1. Design a small tool — with AI support

“Use any AI tool you like. Build a CLI tool that parses logs and summarizes errors.”

=> What it tests:

- Practical system-building
- AI integration with real tooling
- Thought process + UX thinking

2. Live refactoring session

Here’s a messy 300-line file from production. Walk me through how you'd clean it up and modularize it

=> What it tests:

- Code structure sense
- Real-world maintainability
- Communication while coding

3. Async communication challenge

Write a short README for a repo you didn’t build. Explain how to use it — clearly, for a junior dev

=> What it tests:

- Writing clarity
- Teaching mindset
- Product thinking

4. Mock PR review

Review this PR from a junior dev. Comment inline, suggest changes, and explain tradeoffs

Truth is Coding is still important. But coding alone is not enough.

We’re moving to a world where engineers are judged by:

→ Judgment
→ Systems sense
→ AI fluency
→ Team behavior
