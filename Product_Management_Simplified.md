Product Management Simplified in 17 posts.

Even after a decade of being a PM, the one thing that frustrates me most is how people overcomplicate product management for no good reason.

As a result, PMs get so caught up in complex semantics and theory that they miss the core essence of what they should focus on - the fundamentals.

As a writer and PM, I enjoy cutting through the noise to highlight the fundamental meanings of critical topics.

The below posts are my attempt to do just that.

I'll also be diving deep into these topics (and more) in my upcoming course. Details in comments
