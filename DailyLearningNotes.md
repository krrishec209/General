When to Use What?

Use a library when you need specific functionality and want control over how to integrate it.

Use a framework when you're building a full application and want a consistent structure with built-in tools.

Let me know if you want a real-world analogy (like "library is a toolbox vs. framework is a whole kitchen") — or examples in a specific language!
